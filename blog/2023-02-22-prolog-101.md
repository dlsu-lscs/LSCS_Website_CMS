**PROLOG 101** was an online workshop held through a Zoom Meeting by the La Salle Computer Society (LSCS) last February 11, 2023, from 1:00 PM to 2:30 PM. Prolog is a logic programming language associated with artificial intelligence. The workshop’s primary goal is to teach Prolog’s fundamentals and functionality so that participants may be better positioned to begin implementing programs written in Prolog.

Mr. Mark Edward Gonzales, a fourth-year BS/MS Computer Science student, was the speaker for the event. He introduced what Prolog is and what it was used for, talked about the syntax, and showed how to program in Prolog by showing multiple examples. He kept the event interactive by asking participants questions such as what will be the result given a line of code, and informative enough for participants to have a starting point in coding with Prolog.

The event was overall informative, interactive, lively, and well-organized. There were a total of thirty-four participants who attended the workshop. The speaker was also eloquent and knowledgeable of the topic, making the event very effective. This event would not have been made possible if it weren’t for the project heads, Ysobella Torio and Micaela Gutierrez.
