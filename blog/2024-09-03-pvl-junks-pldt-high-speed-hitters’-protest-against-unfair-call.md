Controversy was awakened when the referee did not call a “supposed” net touch during the match between Akari and PLDT last Saturday, August 31, 2024.

The Premier Volleyball League (PVL) released a statement that there was no foul play nor net touch involved, stating that “player 1” already digged on the ball signifying a new action before the blocking player landed on the floor. They also released a screencap on FIVB rules on Contact with the Net.

The PLDT High Speed Hitters decided to file complaint to the PVL Board protesting about the referees’ decision to not call a net touch during the crucial point on their match. They stated that they appreciate the encouragement they were getting from supporters to file a protest to bring back some sense of integrity into the sport.

“Our High Speed Hitters and the coaches have been fighting tooth and nail for every win and every point. This is us, the management, showing that we will fight for them, too. From this point on, we can only hope for the best.” The High Speed Hitters state on their statement.

Later on news broke that they would be pulling out from the invitationals. This was nothing related to the controversy they were caught up with during the semifinals. It was made clear that the pullout was due to the lingering injuries the team has. They would be replaced by the Farm Fresh Foxies.

The PVL board decides to junk the protest that the High Speed Hitters filed. People from the platform X calls this a “robbery in broad daylight” while others are justifying the referees’ decision. PLDT states that they would continue to fight for the integrity of not just their team but of the entirety of Philippine Volleyball.

“So to the kids watching all of this unfold, whatever adversity that comes along the way, please continue to fight. Because we will.” They close their statement on their junked protest.
