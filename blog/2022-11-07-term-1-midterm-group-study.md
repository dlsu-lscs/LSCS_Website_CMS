From October 10 to October 14, 2022, La Salle Computer Society (LSCS) held the Midterm Group Study, an event that would prepare fellow College of Computer Studies (CCS) students for the Midterm Examination Week of AY 2022-2023 Term 1. The purpose of the event was to aid students who were struggling in studying for their midterms, provide ample support to their academic concerns, and answer their questions regarding certain topics to be held on their midterms exam. 



This event was in partnership with **Peer Tutors Society (PTS)**. A set of student tutors from PTS were assigned to teach subjects they excelled in and LSCS processed the pre-activity requirements along with the preparation of publicity materials for the event. The subjects taught during the event were the following: CCPROG1, CCPROG3, CCDSALG, CCICOMP, CSMATH2, and CSARCH1. 



The Midterm Group Study was held through Discord with a total of 36 participants. On October 10-11, 2022, and October 13-14, 2022, the event was asynchronous, where students were free to send their questions on the aforementioned subjects for the tutors to answer synchronously. On October 12, 2022, from 15:00 to 17:00, the event was synchronous, where tutors discussed the topics and answered the students’ questions live.



At the end of the event, most of the participants agreed that the lessons covered were relevant to their academic needs, the tutors were approachable and knowledgeable in discussing the topics, and the overall event challenged them to think critically and attain a deeper understanding of the subjects that were covered. Ysabelle Torio, one of the project heads, stated “The Midterm Group Study was an overall success because it catered to the lessons that students needed to review for their exams and the questions were properly answered by the tutors during the asynchronous group study.” In the future, LSCS hopes to continue the Midterm Group Study and implement it soon as a face-to-face event as it used to be pre-pandemic.



The Midterm Group Study would not have been made possible without the project heads of the Academics Committee in LSCS: Monica Manlises and Ysobella Torio. A special thanks to the following tutors of PTS who dedicated their time to teach the participants of the event: Jonathan Angelo C. Bueno (CCPROG1), Daphne Janelyn L. Go (CCPROG1), Jared Blase Sy (CCPROG1, CCPROG3), Nilo Cantil K. Jatico II (CCPROG1, CCICOMP, CSARCH1), and Maria Monica Manlises (CSMATH2, CCICOMP, CCPROG1, CCDSALG).
