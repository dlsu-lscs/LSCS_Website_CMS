Last October 4, 2019, La Salle Computer Society, led by the Academics committee, held a workshop on Java Database Connection (JDBC) at A703 and A1703 from 10AM to 12PM. At the workshop, attendees were guided in installing and manipulating data on their mySQL workbench. Afterward, attendees were given a chance to experience first-hand how to connect SQL databases to Java applications they personally created using the mySQL connector designed for Java. By the end of the session, participants were able to create a Java Database application that showed all the countries in the world!

All the students who participated in this workshop will surely be able to use what they learned from this informative workshop in their database projects and subjects like CCINFOM.
