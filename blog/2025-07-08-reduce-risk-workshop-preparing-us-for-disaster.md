The recent earthquakes in Myanmar and Thailand were a grave reminder of the dangers of natural disasters. But if a strong earthquake would strike Manila right now, would we, Lasallians, be prepared? This is the issue that the Reduce Risk: Risk Reduction Workshop aimed to address. The event tackled disaster preparation and response, and it made sure to leave its participants equipped for disasters through its tips, strategies, and a special gift as well.



Led by Project Heads Mark Celemen and Carl Lingat, this event focused on the issue of earthquakes, a timely topic given the recent nearby earthquakes. A particular concern is the Big One, a potential earthquake that would cause disastrous effects on Metro Manila if it ever occurs. While such a disaster is unpreventable, events like this are still handy in reducing damage through teaching the best ways of disaster preparation and response.



“A long time ago, DOST warned the Philippines about a huge earthquake that may happen soon, which we now know as the Big One. So, during the event, the speakers focused more on this topic by telling what type of different earthquakes there are, what to do before, during, and after it is happening, and other information or tips that we can do or use in order to prepare for this impending disaster,” said Celemen.



To better equip its participants for disaster response, the project heads collaborated with the Red Cross Youth. Their representatives, Mr. Jefferson Dacut and Mr. Niel Kervin Surigao, were able to provide detailed explanations on the cause of earthquakes, the dangers they bring, and what other disasters can arise because of them. They also gave advice on how to prepare for disasters, such as preparing first aid kits, undergoing building inspections, and learning how to use fire extinguishers. Their disaster response expertise combined with statistics on the dangers of earthquakes resulted in an enriching learning experience for everyone involved.



“The reason why we chose Red Cross Youth is that they are very qualified. The Red Cross, and by extension the Red Cross Youth, have lots of experiences and lots of knowledge to share with everybody, especially those who might not have sufficient knowledge. It was fantastic to work with them because they were very direct, very helpful and very friendly, which makes coordinating for this event very nice and meaningful for those who are involved in this workshop,” said Lingat.



This event was open not only to La Salle Computer Society (LSCS) members, but also to members of Malate, Manila. Since they live in a vulnerable area, this workshop was extra important to help them get prepared for upcoming disasters. Aside from the tips and strategies from the lecture, community members were also given their own first aid kits that came from LSCS’s First Aid Kit Drive.



“We want to leave a positive impact on our participants. So during the event, the speakers disseminated information about the types of disasters, how they are formed, and what we should do before, during, and after they occurred. Other than that, we also distributed first aid kits that we believe will help them be prepared in case these natural or man-made disasters happen,” said Celemen.



“I would like to give a shoutout to everyone in my committee because they have helped us in one way or another, especially in the First Aid Kit Drive where we were able to collect a lot of first aid kits for those communities that we are helping,” said Lingat.



Let’s not wait idly in anticipation for disasters like the Big One to happen. To keep ourselves and our loved one safe, let’s do our part by preparing for earthquakes and other disasters to come. With events like Reduce Risk to point us in the right direction, we can work towards a safer community and ultimately a safer Philippines.
