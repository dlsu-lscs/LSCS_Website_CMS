The Firebase seminar was one among the many seminars the La Salle Computer Society (LSCS) Academics committee has organized with the benefit of the College of Computer Studies (CCS) students in mind. On the 14th of November 2019, speaker Mr. William Aboy, former LSCS Academics Vice President and BSCS - Software Technology alumni, visited De La Salle University once more to share his knowledge of Firebase. Approximately 20 students arrived at room 1108 of the Brother Andrew building to join Mr. Aboy and partake in the seminar.

Project heads Mikayla Tejada and Ryan Yao shared that the Firebase seminar was organized mainly for the ID 117 students taking up MOBAPDE as a course, but was also open for anyone interested in learning more about Firebase and its functionalities.
