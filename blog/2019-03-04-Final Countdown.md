Final Countdown is a programming contest that was held on January 28, 2018. The event was headed by Melody Go (AVP), Hanna Bumanlag (CT), Aaron Fajardo (CT), and the following Junior Officers: Leanne Angulo, Bernice Betito, Alexis Dela Cruz, Christine Deticio, Jason Evangelista, Darren Tan, Maria Carol Teope, and Shimei Zhang. Final Countdown was inspired by the game, “Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes.” The contest aimed not only to challenge the participants' programming capabilities, but also to put their communication skills to the test.

Team that participated in the contest composed of two to four members. Each team is divided into two sections. The first section consists of only one person. This person is allowed to see the broken code. The second section contains the remaining members but they are not allowed to see the broken code. However, they are given a book that contains clues on how to fix the broken code. The two sections are separated by a “divider” and they must communicate with one another to debug the code. To gain points, the program must successfully compile and output the correct answers. Furthermore, the participants must accomplish the code within the given time limit. There were a total of five rounds and each round was more difficult than the previous round.

Most of the teams found it challenging to successfully convey the codes and hints that they have. As time passed, they were able to find their rhythm and successfully answer a few rounds. All in all, the participants had a good and enjoyable time partaking in the Final Countdown.
