About a year into the pandemic, social distancing learning remains to be the preferred method of education. Whether it is through online sessions, television or radio, or written modules and worksheets, many had to adapt to the different environment.  However, not everyone was able to fully adjust to the new normal and some experience difficulty coping with the effects of the changes. The shift to virtual classes affected not only students, but also presented educators problems on how to effectively instill knowledge, skills, and values using the new means of teaching. 

With traditional classes no longer being held, many had to modify their teaching style to suit the new mode of learning. Teachers now need to make use of learning management systems and conferencing platforms, keep lectures easy to understand, and be considerate of the students’ situations. Existing tools such as Zoom, Google Classroom, and Canvas are given more use while in remote learning. Those who were accustomed to face-to-face classes had to adopt these tools and be able to use them efficiently. 

Computer Literacy Program (CLiP) is a term-long event of La Salle Computer Society (LSCS) that provides participants with an opportunity to learn and improve their skills with using computers. This term, CLiP is aimed at helping teachers manage distance learning through Online Guro, introducing different tips and practices to help them become more comfortable in handling virtual classes. Webinars were held via Zoom meeting and Facebook livestream, and speakers were invited to discuss different ways to make online classes more manageable for teachers. 

Last November 28, 2020, Ms. Lourdes Mendoza talked about different tips that can be useful for managing virtual classes such as the use of online learning management systems like Google Classroom and Canvas. She explained how to make lectures and synchronous sessions engaging for students using tips such as proper naming of slide decks, storing them in a repository, and how to make presentations visually appealing. Managing synchronous meetings and making good use of conferencing platforms was further discussed in the webinar.

Another webinar was held last January 16, 2021 that talked about discipline strategies to keep students attentive during classes. The speaker, Ms. Marjorie Nariz, emphasized setting clear rules and instructions for the class and correcting misbehavior in a positive way. Using games or adding incentives to student participation was also discussed. The attendees were reminded that everyone is experiencing changes caused by the pandemic and that school teachers should consider the circumstances that their students may be facing.

Teaching is not an easy task, and this has never been more true during this pandemic that has forced many to change their methods. It is important to ensure that students are still learning and not simply complying with school requirements. Those who were more comfortable with traditional classes have to rethink their approach towards lectures, assessments, and activities. Both students and teachers alike have experienced problems adjusting to the online classes and work-from-home settings. Through Online Guro, LSCS hopes to help educators keep up with the changes and translate their teaching abilities into the remote learning environment.
