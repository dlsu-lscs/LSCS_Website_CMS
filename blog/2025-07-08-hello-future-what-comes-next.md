On March 26, 2025, La Salle Computer Society hosted the Hello, Future!: Career Horizons Roadshow for the academic year 2024-2025. 



Hosted by Nathaniel Tolentino and Neo Almin, the event kicked off with an introduction to Seven Seven Seven, a global IT-BPM company with expertise in providing top-caliber IT professionals to Fortune 500 companies.



The first company talk, led by application developers Erick Leaño and Annah Batara, put a strong emphasis on Seven Seven’s in-house development of business and AI applications. He then gave an overview of their Career Development Program.



"What Seven Seven looks for is your willingness to learn", Leaño said.



Batara took to presenting the sample technologies and frameworks, with an interesting chart showing their roadmap detailing the opportunities that came with each position.



“You are continuously trained with the latest technologies to increase your market value”, she professed.



Both of the Seven Seven representatives said that they are always in search of applicants looking for a solid career foundation in IT, each sharing their CDP journey and how they started to where they are now with the company.



“We are very much excited to have you guys as our colleagues,” said Leaño and Batara.



Following the intermission, the second company talk was led by Martin Murillo, currently an IT Manager at Procter & Gamble, who went on to talk about “The Soft Skills Every Tech Graduate Needs,” where effective communication sets you apart from others.



“Communication isn’t just a one-way street, so communicating effectively also involves listening actively.”



Riley Veracruz, Project Head and Associate Vice President for Corporate Relations, commented on the eagerness of industry professionals to tackle career and leadership development.



“The tech industry itself is rapidly growing and evolving; hence, having professionals discuss current trends and developments helps young and aspiring students stay on pace with the industry,” he said.



Kellyn Senas, Project Head and Vice President for Corporate Relations, has shared this same sentiment.



“It’s critical to bridge the gap, especially between students and industry professionals. The academic journey is incomplete without input and experience in the world of tech innovation. Evidently, as industry professionals continue to educate students, the students will then be equipped with the right information and skills as they finally step into the industry.”
