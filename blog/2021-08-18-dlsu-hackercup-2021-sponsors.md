Hackercup is one of the flagship events of De La Salle University’s La Salle Computer Society showcasing the creativity of the participants in ideating solutions towards real-world issues, particularly in the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals. This year was the second online installment of Hackercup which was held last July 9 to 10 at Discord, Zoom, and streamed on DLSU Hackercup Facebook Page. The first day both tackled the workshop and competition proper of the event to formulate their chosen prototype, while the second day is the continuation of the latter to present the participants’ ideas.
