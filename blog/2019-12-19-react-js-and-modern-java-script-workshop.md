Wherever we go, we frequently see technologies from one place to another. It can be seen that the society is vastly influenced by it which is already considered as part of their daily lives. One of the influential technologies today is social media which involves the internet to access its cyberspace. Take Facebook for example, people can post, comment or react, communicate, check the news feed, and more. However, these social medias wouldn't exist today without intensive implementation of web programming, web design, and database system.

For the LSCS Research and Development committee, La Salle Computer Society (LSCS) decided to conduct a workshop called React.js and Modern Javascript Workshop, with its project heads, namely, Lynux Ansay (117, BS CS), LSCS Vice President in Research and Development and Ma. Patricia Villaroman (117, BS CS), LSCS Associate Vice President in Research and Development. The workshop is similar to LSCS Design Sprint Workshop that was also arranged specifically for the R&D committee. The event was held on October 18, 2019 at Gokongwei building in room 202. Its objective is to teach the LSCS R&D officers React.js and modern JavaScript to have the knowledge for web development for the purpose of their future projects in the organization. What is React and JavaScript used for? React is a tool for building front-ends or user interface components and it is one of the famous technologies existing today. JavaScript, on the other hand, is a programming language commonly used for the back-ends of the web.

During the workshop, the R&D members and other participant(s), who are also welcome, immersed themselves in programming and designing with their respective laptops in order to confirm their understanding with their invited speaker, Neilson Gardose, a fresh graduate, guiding them through programming and designing as well for demonstration after the discussion. In the end, the participants were able to implement the syntax and the program the speaker wanted them to construct which made the workshop a success.
