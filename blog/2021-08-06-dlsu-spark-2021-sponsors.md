SPARK is an annual event held by De La Salle University’s La Salle Computer Society to introduce high school students to a variety of topics under the fields of informatics and computing through a series of short talks and a culminating case competition.  This year was the first-ever iteration of SPARK that was held online, wherein workshops on Game Development, Cybersecurity, Artificial Intelligence and Personal Informatics were tackled. This ended with an IT Solutions Case Challenge with the theme “How will you incorporate technological innovations to create a sustainable community?”. The participants showed how much they’ve learned in our workshops as seen on the solutions they presented during the ideathon. All of this would not be possible without the esteemed partners and co-presenters of SPARK 2021.

**Power through remote learning with Switch**

The global pandemic has changed how we live, work and study, but that doesn’t mean change has to be difficult. With Switch, remote learning is easier than ever before.

Students deserve the best equipment to lighten the heavy load of online learning. The MacBook is not only portable but it also has a FaceTime HD camera with advanced image signal processor for clearer, sharper video calls. Pair it with your Airpods for its rich, high-quality sounds, giving you hands-free participation during class lectures.

iMac now comes packed with the latest processors, faster memory, and powerful graphics. And it has the brightest, most vibrant Retina display on a Mac. The fast and rechargeable Magic Keyboard is a whole new experience when it comes to typing for your iMac. When equipped with Mac Mini, the iMac is sure to get you through the semester with flying colors.

Switch’s selection of iPads are lightweight and capable. Whether you need to take notes or draw some diagrams for a class, the iPad makes it all easier with just a swipe of your Apple Pencil. We have a selection of cases for your iPad so take your pick from multi-fit protective Atlas or the Smart Keyboard Folio, a full-size keyboard with front and back protection.

Aside from the Apple-branded accessories, Switch also offers other accessories from your favorite brands such as Griffin, Logitech, Belkin, Moshi and PanzerGlass. With these brands, you can choose from a wide array of iPad & Macbook cases, bags, adapters & ports, screen protectors and so much more. 

Switch now offers [AppleCare Protection Plan](https://istore.ph/blogs/newsroom/applecare-products) which ensures that its consumers make the most out of Apple and its products. With AppleCare, you are able to extend the regular 90-day warranty on your device so your issues and concerns can easily be handled and addressed through an [Apple Certified Service Provider](https://istore.ph/blogs/newsroom/why-should-you-choose-an-apple-authorized-service-provider).
