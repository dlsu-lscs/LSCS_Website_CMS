Every term, La Salle Computer Society's Tech Talks brings students and industry professionals together to discuss the latest trends in technology. On March 19, the focus was on AI in software development and building scalable systems for businesses, giving attendees a glimpse into how technology is shaping the industry today.



One of the most discussed topics was the role of AI in software engineering. With tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT becoming more advanced, many are asking whether AI will replace software engineers or simply serve as an enhancement to their workflow. According to Devon Javier, the event’s project head, this was a major point of discussion:



“Co-pilot, ChatGPT… will they replace us as software engineers? That was a question on everyone’s mind during the talk.”



The conversation wasn’t just about automation, but about how AI is actively changing the way software is built. While AI can handle repetitive coding tasks, the consensus was that human intuition and problem-solving remain essential.



Another key discussion was on building systems for businesses and applying best practices to ensure software development meets real-world needs. Devon explained the goal of these discussions:



“We wanted to make sure students were engaged with modern topics, so we picked AI and software systems because they’re shaping the industry right now.”



With technology evolving rapidly, exposure to real-world industry insights is more important than ever. For the organizers, success wasn’t just about hosting a talk but continuing the tradition of giving students valuable knowledge from professionals.



“Even if they learned just a little bit of insider knowledge from the speakers, I think that’s enough to call the talk a success.”



The future of AI in software development remains an open question, but one thing is certain—understanding its impact is key for anyone entering the tech industry.
