From March 13 - 21 the La Salle Computer Society (LSCS) proved that technology isn’t the only thing they can debug—they can also solve other problems with the launch of ReduceRisk( ): The First Aid Kit Drive.



Led by the Socio-Civic committee and their dynamic and passionate project head, Donita Taguibao, this initiative brought together tech enthusiasts and community heroes to make a tangible difference in the lives of those in need.

The society also partnered with DLSU Red Cross Youth Council to identify communities most in need, as well as bring in more volunteers thus helping spread the reach of the campaign.



The week-long drive was a whirlwind of creativity and community spirit. LSCS members constructed donation boxes, paid for some of the kits straight from their own pockets, and even shared the word on social media,



The main approach for this drive was to order first aid kits from Shopee or Lazada and bring them to a donation box. But naturally, some people are lazy and don’t want to bother with all that extra effort, why not just pay for kits instead right?



“They might not be encouraged to donate through the normal approach so we made it easier for them if ever they wanted to contribute to the cause.”



So, her team prepared 50 ready-to-go first aid kits for those who’d rather donate cash. And guess what? Every single kit sold out.



This wasn’t just about collecting supplies, it was about sparking a spirit of generosity. The Socio-Civic committee pulled out all the stops: Doc McStuffins-themed posters, org-wide profile pic campaigns, and email blasts ensured no Lasallian could miss the call to action. 



And the result? A flood of donations that went straight to those who needed them most. But as Donita reflected, the real victory wasn’t just in the numbers, it was also in the mindset.

“This drive really promoted safety preparedness and fostered generosity among everyone as it gave them purpose and motivation to give to those in need. In that manner, we achieved the objectives of the Socio-Civic committee and helped everyone develop.”



By the end of the drive, LSCS didn’t just deliver first aid kits, they delivered hope, awareness, and a stronger sense of community. They proved that even in a tech-driven world, human connection is the most powerful code of all.
