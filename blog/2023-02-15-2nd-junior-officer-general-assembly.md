**The 2nd Junior Officer General Assembly (JOGA)** was held last February 8, 2023, mainly to showcase the JO Events that were meticulously planned and organized by the Junior Officers (JOs). This event also presented an excellent opportunity for the JOs to build camaraderie, show a sense of competitiveness, and hopefully make lasting friendships. This JOGA was special compared to the previous ones as it was on-site—a first for JOGAs since the pandemic!

The General Assembly took off with a prayer and an enthusiastic greeting from the hosts. Of course, the 11 JO events were showcased, but the long-awaited announcement of the JO committee deployment also took place. The event ended with a few announcements and a closing prayer, followed by a heartwarming video presentation by the Publicity and Creatives (Pubs) team and a photo opportunity with everyone in attendance. The JOs also enjoyed some snacks as they made their way out of the venue.

Initially, the mood in the venue was still quite shy and quiet which was understandable. They were meeting their fellow JOs for the first time in person after all, but the ice gradually broke thanks to the game-based activities that were spread throughout the event. The teams who played the three games prepared for the GA were comprised of the same 11 groups that worked on the JO events. The members of each of these groups sat next to each other for the duration of the event while being guided by their Training and Development Associate Vice Presidents (TND AVPs) in charge along the way.

Overall, the event proved to be a success! The JOs were not only introduced to the different processes and events in the organization, but they also had a great time getting acquainted with each other and demonstrating a competitive spirit. AVP for TND, Rey Inocencio, even had this to say: “I am always passionate about fostering a healthy and welcoming environment within our Junior Officers; as such, I'm thrilled that the turnout of our Second General Assembly was great. Not only did the Junior Officers enjoy, but they also deepened the bond they had with each other and their respective AVPs.” Of course, the event would not have been possible without the officers who were hard at work prior to and during the event. Mr. Inocencio continued, “-seeing my co-AVPs all passionate in preparing and implementing this event truly warms my heart and I'm happy that we can all participate in furthering TND and LSCS' goals.”

> ***For the future leaders of LSCS, stay passionate, committed, and grounded. Serve the members out of love, not out of obligation. There will be challenging times, but always remember that you are not alone in continuing the legacy of the organization. If there’s one thing I want to ask from you, it is to continue making LSCS a family — the second home of, not only the CCS community but of any Lasallian who is interested and passionate about technology. Good luck!***
