Tech is for everyone.



At least, it should be. However, reality isn’t that simple. It’s no secret that tech-related fields like Information Technology (IT) and Computer Science (CS) are heavily male-dominated; one look at the College of Computer Studies (CCS) population already makes it pretty apparent. But does it really have to stay this way?



At HERcode, HERstory, three accomplished women came to De La Salle University (DLSU) to share their success stories – how they were able to survive and thrive in an industry that stacked the odds against them.



The first speaker, Ms. Maez de Guzman, comes from EY Global Delivery Services as a leader in cybersecurity. Along with her colleague, Ms. Ninna Manzano, they work in the so-called “Blue Team”; stopping hackers and threats dead in their tracks before they can breach any critical systems.



One of the key things you should do in the industry, she says, is to have crystal clear goals. In Maez’ words, her initial philosophy was to “go where the money is”. It takes skill to identify which particular fields will be highly in demand in the next few years, and for her, cybersecurity was that field.



Cybersecurity is not an easy field to work in. It requires a lot of technical expertise, and often leads to sleepless nights – Maez recounts many times where she had to wake up at 1am just to accept emergency tickets. But for her, it’s a fulfilling job, to have a part in building a more secure world. 



According to Maez, you should also be able to assess your own aptitudes well, and know what keeps you going. Loving your career and your job is essential for a good lifestyle, and if you’re not good at what you do, then you’ll eventually grow to hate it. It’s important to love what you do and have the skills to perform it well too.



Ms. Bee Sarmiento, Creative Director of Breadwork Games, offers a different perspective. As someone who chose to be an indie game developer over working in the corporate world, she had to build her career from the ground up. 



For Bee, games and storytelling were her passions. And it’s definitely not easy to turn your passion into something you can make a living off of. With the industry being so competitive, how could you hope to find your place in it?



As a new person in the tech industry, you should start by doing, Bee says. Although it may not seem like it, there’s a ton of unexplored space in the market. If you want to get into game development, then boot up Unity or Godot and just start! Even if it might turn out bad, it’s important to not be afraid of failure. The important thing is to make something with your own skills, and to continue trying to improve. 



“Games are for everyone”, Bee remarks. They serve as an avenue to express yourself and tell the story you want to tell. You shouldn’t be afraid to put yourself out there, because if you won’t share your story to the world, then who will?



Project heads Charles Infante and Jenrick Lim weighed in with their thoughts on the impact of events like HERcode: “We want \[the audience] to feel encouraged and inspired by these speakers”, explains Jenrick. “Even me, as a male, I got inspired by them… I got enlightened about everything in their fields and how they are working right now.” 



“It’s about empowering those who are \[in] the minority. Women are the minority in a lot of STEM fields, especially tech. And it’s important to empower these women to keep on pushing through, keep on pursuing this field”, Charles adds.



March may be coming to an end, but let us continue to carry the spirit of Women’s Month with us. These speakers who shared their stories with us serve as living examples that women can and should be in tech. That no matter who you are, as long as you have the drive to make a difference, you are capable of succeeding.
