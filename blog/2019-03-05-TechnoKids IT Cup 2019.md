In partnership with Technokids, La Salle Computer Society (LSCS) annually organizes the TechnoKids IT Cup. This event aims to give the participants a better idea of what Information Technology (IT) is all about and to encourage them to pursue a career in the field of IT. TechnoKids IT Cup 2019 was held on January 19 and 26 at the Teresa Yuchengco Auditorium and 5/F Multipurpose Hall, Henry Sy Sr. Hall, respectively. There were 5 types of competitions held, namely the IT Quiz Bee, Robotics Cup, Graphic Design Competition, Web Design Competition, and Animation Competition. A total of 75 schools participated for TechnoKids IT Cup 2019 .

The IT Quiz Bee had 2 divisions: grade school and high school. Two students per division were chosen to represent their school for the quiz bee and a third representative serving as a substitute. The quiz bee focused on topics about computer fundamentals, gaming, web development, and current trends and issues. The IT Quiz Bee had a preliminary round which had 3 categories (easy, average, and difficult).The top 10 schools with the highest scores would move on to compete in the final round.

Meanwhile, The Robotics Competition was divided into 2 parts, the Robotics Wildcard Competition, and the Last Roboman Standing Competition. For the Robotics Competition, the participants would code with EV3 programming to make their robot perform the challenges assigned to them. Each school was represented by a team with three students and 1 Roboman. The Robotics Wildcard Competition had several challenges wherein the difficulty of the challenges increases. Each team only has 3 minutes to complete a challenge. Only the top 10 schools with the fastest time can qualify for the Last Roboman Standing Competition. The mechanics for the the Last Roboman Standing Competition is the same as the Robotics Wildcard Competition. However, the order of difficulty of the challenges are reversed. That is, the teams would have to complete the hardest challenge first.

For the Graphic Design Competition, Web Design Competition, and Animation Competition, the participants were tasked to create a graphic design, a web design, or a short animation according to a theme. After the allotted time had passed, the judges evaluated the participants’ work based on a rubric set by Technokids.

Through the different competitions held for TechnoKids 2019 IT Cup, the participants were able to to showcase their skills and knowledge. LSCS and TechnoKids would like to congratulate the following schools for winning in this year’s TechnoKids IT CUP:
