**The Online Midterm Reviewer Distribution (OMRD)** was disseminated on February 13, 2023 for the use of CCS students. This collaborative project by **La Salle Computer Society (LSCS)** and **Peer Tutor Society (PTS)** was distributed through a link on LSCS’ official social media pages. Students may look into the consolidated Google Drive and Github Repository for review materials, sample codes, and practice exercises to prepare them for the incoming midterms.



Subjects that currently have accessible materials include the following: *CCPROG1*, *CCPROG2*, *CSMATH1*, *CCDSTRU*, *CSADPRG*, *CSALGCM*, *ST-MATH*, and more subjects to be added in the future. Those especially in their first or second year may find these materials helpful for their review. In conjunction with the Midterm Group Study held from February 13 to 17, students were even able to inquire and ask about the contents of the OMRD.



This project was headed by Monica Manlises and Jacob Villa, while PTS was in charge of consolidating the reviewers. These materials were prepared by PTS Tutors making their own self-made reviewers, practice exams, and sample codes. Additionally, PTS’ idea for having a GitHub Repository has only been started as of this term.
